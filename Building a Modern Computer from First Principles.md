I was always searching for a well-structured course that simulate building a modern computer, and while checking the <a href = "https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Teach Your Self Computer Science</a> website. 

I found this awesome structured and simulating course in the <a href ="https://www.nand2tetris.org/course"> From Nand to Tetris: Building a Modern Computer from First Principles</a>  project section.

Which contains 12 projects. Each project card contains the name of the project and 3 icons, the first icon's link leads to a pdf containing the project instructions, the second icon's link leads to the lecture slide and the third icon's link leads to the relevant chapter from the book entitled The Elements of Computing Systems <br>
